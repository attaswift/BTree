/// A sorted collection of comparable elements; also known as a multiset.
/// `SortedBag` is like a `SortedSet` except it can contain multiple members that are equal to each other.
/// Lookup, insertion and removal of any element has logarithmic complexity.
///
/// `SortedBag` stores duplicate elements in their entirety; it doesn't just count multiplicities.
/// This is an important feature when equal elements can be distinguished by identity comparison or some other means.
/// (If you're OK with just counting duplicates, use a `Map` or a `Dictionary` with the multiplicity as the value.)
///
/// `SortedBag` is a struct with copy-on-write value semantics, like Swift's standard collection types.
/// It uses an in-memory b-tree for element storage, whose individual nodes may be shared with other sorted sets or bags.
/// Mutating a bag whose storage is (partially or completely) shared requires copying of only O(log(`count`)) elements.
/// (Thus, mutation of shared `SortedBag`s may be cheaper than ordinary `Set`s, which need to copy all elements.)
///
/// Set operations on sorted bags (such as taking the union, intersection or difference) can take as little as
/// O(log(n)) time if the elements in the input bags aren't too interleaved.
