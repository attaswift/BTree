/// A sorted collection of unique comparable elements.
/// `SortedSet` is like `Set` in the standard library, but it always keeps its elements in ascending order.
/// Lookup, insertion and removal of any element has logarithmic complexity.
///
/// `SortedSet` is a struct with copy-on-write value semantics, like Swift's standard collection types.
/// It uses an in-memory b-tree for element storage, whose individual nodes may be shared with other sorted sets.
/// Mutating a set whose storage is (partially or completely) shared requires copying of only O(log(`count`)) elements.
/// (Thus, mutation of shared `SortedSet`s may be cheaper than ordinary `Set`s, which need to copy all elements.)
///
/// Set operations on sorted sets (such as taking the union, intersection or difference) can take as little as
/// O(log(n)) time if the elements in the input sets aren't too interleaved.
